Overview:
Advent of Code is an advent calendar with small programming puzzles every day, created by Eric Wastle (http://was.tl/),
designed to be solved with any programming language with almost any hardware.
This repository is my contribution and tries to solve this puzzles.
I'm not going for highscores, as my goals for these challenges are to reinforce my general coding and problem-solving
skills and see how far I can go.

Language:
For my solutions I use Python 3.11, as Python is the language I'm most comfortable with.
